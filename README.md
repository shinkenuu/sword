# SWORD tech test

### Quickstart

```shell
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Requirements

You are developing a software to account for maintenance tasks performed during a working day. This application has two
types of users (Manager, Technician). The technician performs tasks and is only able to see, create or update his own
performed tasks. The manager can see tasks from all the technicians, delete them, and should be notified when some tech
performs a task. A task has a summary (max: 2500 characters) and a date when it was performed, the summary from the task
can contain personal information.

### Notes

- If you don’t have enough time to complete the test you should prioritize complete features ( with tests) over many
  features. We’ll evaluate security, quality and readability of your code
- This test is suitable for all levels of developers, so make sure to prove yours

### Development Features

- Create API endpoint to save a new task
- Create API endpoint to list tasks
- Notify manager of each task performed by the tech (This notification can be just a print saying “The tech X performed
  the task Y on date Z”)
- This notification should not block any http request

### Tech Requirements:

- Use any language to develop this HTTP API (we use Go, Node and PHP)
- Create a local development environment using docker containing this service and a MySQL database
- Use MySQL database to persist data from the application
- Features should have unit tests to ensure they are working properly

### Bonus:

- Use a message broker to decouple notification logic from the application flow
- Create Kubernetes object files needed to deploy this application
